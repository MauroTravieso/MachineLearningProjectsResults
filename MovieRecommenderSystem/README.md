Embedded Method

Recursive Feature Elimination

## Information Filtering Systems

### Demographic Filtering

The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. The most popular Movies are recommended. IMDB's weighted rating is used to obtain the score.

### Content Based Filtering 

It suggests similar items based on a particular one. The general idea is that if a person ranked  a particular item, will also be suitable to rank an item with similarities.

### Collaborative Filtering

It is not focused on personal interests of users. It is only suggests movies which are related to a certain one. It is not able to provide recommendations among movie genres.

### NFC

Optimization of the Collaborative Filtering using Neural Networks

### Acuracy of the system: 

Mean absolute error: 71%
